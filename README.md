This Network.luau system provides  high abstraction layer for Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and messaging within a distributed computing environment in Roblox applications. It is meticulously engineered to empower developers to execute remote operations and manage asynchronous events as if they were calling local functions, thereby mitigating the inherent complexities of direct network communication in a client-server architecture.

Event and Function Binding Allows registration of event handlers (callbacks) and function handlers on both the client and server sides for specific named events or functions.
- Includes timeout handling for failed invocations and error detection. It also provides network traffic logging capabilities.
